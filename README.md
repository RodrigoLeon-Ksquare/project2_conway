| 1. As a user, whenever I navigate to the website and see an empty grid with the option to let the user set up the initial configuration.                           |              |                |       X        |
| 2. If the game is paused I can resume it.                                                                                                                          |              |       X        |                |
| 3. I can clear the board.                                                                                                                                          |              |       X        |                |
| 4. I can click a 'Randomize' button that will generate an initial configuration for the game to play and this can only be done when the games has not yet started. |      X       |                |                |
| 5. I can see the amount of generation has passed since the start of the game.                                                                                      |              |                |       X        |
| 6. I can click a button that would set the game back to the initial state (how the website initially loads in).                                                    |      X       |                |                |
